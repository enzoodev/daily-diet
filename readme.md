## About the Project

The Daily-Diet app is an ideal diet monitoring app for daily use. In it, you can record your meals daily and classify them as you wish. The app will store them in your device's local storage, so they will only be deleted if you choose to. Another interesting point is that the app has an exclusive screen for the main statistics of your meals, in addition to the other 5 pages that make up the entire application.
